Psuedo-Code


1. Define the constants:

const boardSize = [{beginner :8}, {intermediate: 16},{expert:24}];
const mines = [{beginner :10}, {intermediate: 40},{expert:99}];

2. Define app state variables:
const arrBeginner = [
[{""},{""}],
[],
];

const arrIntermediate = [
[{""},{""}],
[],
];

const arrExpert = [
[{""},{""}],
[],
];
let gameStatus;

3. cached elements --> cells of the boxes, flagCount, timer
4. Render board based on difficulty (main js)
5. Create/invoke random method to place the mines. (main js)
6. Update the state array board variable to access the placed mines.(object with mine property true, reveal property false, value property 0) -->
7. Create a function and invoke it to calculate the number of mines in nearby 8 cells (main js)
8. Update the state array variable with the above calculated numbers (object with mine property false, reveal property true value property number)
9. Update the state array variable with "" if there are no nearby 8 cells. (object with mine property false, reveal property false, value property -1)

[Call Cell class with the array to create those many objects]
10. Create a function to handle [in Cell Class] --> 
     if clicked on mine cell --> terminate by revealing all the cells with mines (update game status - L)
     if clicked on "" cell --> reveal all the cell till it encounters a number cell (update game status - null)
     if clicked on number cell --> reveal it only (update game status - null)
	has bombs
	has flags
	......	
11. Create a function to start timer on first cell click. (main js)
12. Create a function for end timer --> on mine cell click / game status is L or W (main js)

11. Winning logic if only those cells are left un-revealed that has mine. / game status W


class of Cell --> 


Think about array classes.

Think about local storage of time and player maybe
